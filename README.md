# PHP Null Check Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP functions involving null checks. The `my_function` incorrectly handles null arguments, returning null when either argument is null, instead of potentially handling them differently or throwing an exception.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach.

## Bug Description:
The provided function `my_function` is supposed to perform some operation. However, the null check is flawed.  It returns null immediately if either argument is null. This isn't always the desired behavior; a more sophisticated approach might be necessary depending on the function's logic and purpose.

## Solution:
The solution file presents improved error handling, either checking each argument individually or using a more appropriate null coalescing operator.
